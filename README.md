# Advent of Code 2021

I will be using Python to do Advent of Code 2021. I am starting Advent of Code in mid-December, so I may be doing multiple days of challenges to catch up.

## Progress
Day 0 (12/15) - Learned how to set up Git and GitHub. I followed freeCodeCamp's YouTube tutorial.

Day 1 (12/16) - Completed both part 1 and part 2. I used an online converter to turn the column of values provided into comma separated values, so that I could copy the input into my program easily. This is the first time I have used Python or done any object-oriented programming in a few months, so it also took a little while to familiarize myself with the syntax.

Day 2 (12/16) - Part 1 meant relearning how to read a text file input, since there was not a simple online converter I could use. Part 2 was pretty easy, just slightly confusing about the actual instructions.

Day 3 (12/17) - Refamiliarized myself with using numpy for the arrays. I really struggled with how to navigate a 2d array in Python; my indexing approach was not efficient.

Day 4 (12/17) - Incorporated functions and objects/classes.

Day 4 (1/6) - After taking a break, restarted Day 4. Used Jeffery Frederic's YouTube video for understanding since my initial approach was becoming too complex for me to get through. Interesting to see a triple list comprehension.

Day 5 (1/20) - followed Jeffrey Frederic's YouTube video for this as well. I initially struggled with understanding even the basic example, so this tutorial was very necessary.

Day 6 (1/20) - able to do part 1 by myself pretty easily. The exponential increase for part 2 is tricky to navigate.

Day 7 (1/21) - started part 1.

Day 7 (1/22) - Completed both parts independently. Used a mathematical formula to complete part 2, so there was very little change in the code between the parts.

Day 8 (1/22) - Started part 1.
