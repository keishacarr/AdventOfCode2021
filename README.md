# Advent of Code 2021

I will be using Python to do this year's Advent of Code. I am starting Advent of Code in mid-December

## Progress
Day 0 (12/15) - Learning how to set up Git and GitHub. I am following a YouTube tutorial, created by freeCodeCamp.org. Trying again to make sure account is correct.
