# Advent of Code 2021

I will be using Python to do this year's Advent of Code. I am starting Advent of Code in mid-December, so I may be doing multiple days of challenges to catch up.

## Progress
Day 0 (12/15) - Learning how to set up Git and GitHub. I am following freeCodeCamp's YouTube tutorial.
Day 1 (12/16) - Completed both part 1 and part 2. I used an online converter to turn the column of values provided into comma separated values, so that I could copy the input into my program easily. This is the first time I have used Python in a few months, so it also took a little while to familiarize myself with the syntax.
